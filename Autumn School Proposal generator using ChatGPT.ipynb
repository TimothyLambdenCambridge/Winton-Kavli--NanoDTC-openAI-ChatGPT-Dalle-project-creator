      "Abstract:\n",
      "This research proposal aims to integrate facial action coding and machine learning techniques to advance our understanding of two distinct areas: the welfare assessment of cats with cerebellar hypoplasia (CH) and the characterization and measurement of Silicon CMOS quantum devices. The project aims to use facial action coding system (CatFACS) to assess the quality of life of cats with CH based on their facial expressions. Additionally, diverse machine learning methodologies, such as Bayesian analysis, variational algorithms, and reinforcement learning, will be employed to streamline the measurement and characterization process of Silicon quantum devices. The integration of these techniques will provide valuable insights into the welfare of cats and enhance the efficiency, accuracy, and reliability of quantum device measurement and characterization.\n",
      "\n",
      "Introduction:\n",
      "Cats with cerebellar hypoplasia (CH) experience impaired motor skills, potentially affecting their quality of life. This study intends to explore the use of facial action coding system (CatFACS) as a welfare assessment tool for cats with CH. Additionally, the project aims to optimize the characterization and measurement of Silicon CMOS quantum devices using diverse machine learning techniques. Both areas of research have the potential to significantly contribute to their respective fields.\n",
      "\n",
      "Methods:\n",
      "For the assessment of cat welfare, facial expressions (action units [AUs]) will be defined as neutral/positive or negative by recording cats with CH during scenarios assumed to promote negative valence. The AUs expressed by CH cats will be compared to those expressed by presumed positively- and negatively-valenced healthy cats. Infrared thermography will be used to measure the lacrimal caruncle temperature as an additional indicator of emotional state. The data will be analyzed using statistical methods to determine the association between AUs, CH severity, and welfare.\n",
      "\n",
      "For the optimization of Silicon quantum devices, diverse machine learning techniques, including Bayesian analysis, variational algorithms, and reinforcement learning, will be explored and implemented. The focus will be on developing robust models that minimize the time and effort required for measurement and characterization of each device. Efficiency, accuracy, and reliability will be assessed, and comparisons will be made against traditional measurement and characterization methods.\n",
      "\n",
      "Expected Results and Impact:\n",
      "The integration of facial action coding and machine learning techniques will provide a comprehensive understanding of the welfare of cats with CH and improve the measurement and characterization process of Silicon quantum devices. The identification of distinct AUs associated with negatively-valenced arousal in CH cats can be utilized to infer their welfare. The optimization of quantum devices using machine learning will enhance efficiency and accuracy, making significant contributions to the field of quantum computing and technology.\n",
      "\n",
      "Conclusion:\n",
      "This research proposal seeks to combine the use of facial action coding and machine learning techniques to assess the welfare of cats with cerebellar hypoplasia and optimize the measurement and characterization of Silicon quantum devices. The findings from this study have the potential to enhance our understanding of cat welfare and contribute to the advancement of quantum computing and technology. Further research in these areas will pave the way for improved quality of life for cats with CH and accelerate advancements in quantum computing.\n"

      "Abstract:\n",
      "This research proposal aims to investigate two important aspects of sustainable energy storage technologies: the nanoscale structure of beam-sensitive materials and the degradation of electrolytes in metal-ion batteries. By utilizing advanced techniques such as cryogenic scanning transmission electron microscopy (CryoSTEM) and computer simulations, this study seeks to provide insights into optimizing data acquisition strategies and understanding electrochemical reactivity. The proposed research has the potential to contribute to the development of next-generation materials for photovoltaics and the improvement of battery performance, ultimately leading to sustainable energy solutions.\n",
      "\n",
      "Introduction:\n",
      "Recent advancements in electron microscopy techniques have opened up new opportunities for examining the nanoscale structure of beam-sensitive materials. However, there is a need to optimize data acquisition strategies to minimize sample damage while maximizing data quality. Additionally, the degradation of electrolytes in metal-ion batteries is a significant challenge in the development of long-lasting and reliable energy storage systems. Understanding and controlling electrolyte reactivity is crucial for the formation of solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) layers and the overall performance of batteries.\n",
      "\n",
      "Methods:\n",
      "The research will be conducted using two different techniques: CryoSTEM and computer simulations. CryoSTEM will be employed to investigate the nanoscale structure of various beam-sensitive materials, including perovskites for photovoltaics, biological macromolecules, and bioelectronic polymers. Innovative methods such as ice-free cryo holders, smart scanning, and in-painting will be optimized to enhance data quality.\n",
      "\n",
      "In parallel, computer simulations will be conducted using density functional theory, chemical reaction networks, kinetic Monte Carlo, data science, transition-state theory, and Marcus theory. These simulations will be used to predict electrolyte decomposition mechanisms in conventional Li-ion batteries and next-generation batteries. Design rules will be identified to aid in the development of novel electrolytes and battery charging protocols.\n",
      "\n",
      "Expected Results and Sustainable Impact:\n",
      "The optimization of CryoSTEM acquisition strategies will lead to improved data quality for the investigation of beam-sensitive materials. This will contribute to the development of next-generation materials for photovoltaic applications, as well as advancements in the understanding of biological macromolecules and bioelectronic polymers.\n",
      "\n",
      "The computer simulations of electrolyte degradation and SEI formation will provide atomistic insights into electrolyte reactivity. This knowledge will help identify design rules for the development of novel electrolytes, enabling the production of long-lasting and reliable metal-ion batteries. By improving battery performance, this research will have a significant impact on enhancing sustainable energy solutions and reducing our reliance on internal combustion engines in the transportation sector.\n",
      "\n",
      "Conclusion:\n",
      "This research proposal outlines a comprehensive investigation of two key aspects of sustainable energy storage technologies: the nanoscale structure of beam-sensitive materials and the degradation of electrolytes in metal-ion batteries.
