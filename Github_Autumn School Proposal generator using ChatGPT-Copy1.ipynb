      "Abstract:\n",
      "This research proposal aims to investigate two important aspects of sustainable energy storage technologies: the nanoscale structure of beam-sensitive materials and the degradation of electrolytes in metal-ion batteries. By utilizing advanced techniques such as cryogenic scanning transmission electron microscopy (CryoSTEM) and computer simulations, this study seeks to provide insights into optimizing data acquisition strategies and understanding electrochemical reactivity. The proposed research has the potential to contribute to the development of next-generation materials for photovoltaics and the improvement of battery performance, ultimately leading to sustainable energy solutions.\n",
      "\n",
      "Introduction:\n",
      "Recent advancements in electron microscopy techniques have opened up new opportunities for examining the nanoscale structure of beam-sensitive materials. However, there is a need to optimize data acquisition strategies to minimize sample damage while maximizing data quality. Additionally, the degradation of electrolytes in metal-ion batteries is a significant challenge in the development of long-lasting and reliable energy storage systems. Understanding and controlling electrolyte reactivity is crucial for the formation of solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) layers and the overall performance of batteries.\n",
      "\n",
      "Methods:\n",
      "The research will be conducted using two different techniques: CryoSTEM and computer simulations. CryoSTEM will be employed to investigate the nanoscale structure of various beam-sensitive materials, including perovskites for photovoltaics, biological macromolecules, and bioelectronic polymers. Innovative methods such as ice-free cryo holders, smart scanning, and in-painting will be optimized to enhance data quality.\n",
      "\n",
      "In parallel, computer simulations will be conducted using density functional theory, chemical reaction networks, kinetic Monte Carlo, data science, transition-state theory, and Marcus theory. These simulations will be used to predict electrolyte decomposition mechanisms in conventional Li-ion batteries and next-generation batteries. Design rules will be identified to aid in the development of novel electrolytes and battery charging protocols.\n",
      "\n",
      "Expected Results and Sustainable Impact:\n",
      "The optimization of CryoSTEM acquisition strategies will lead to improved data quality for the investigation of beam-sensitive materials. This will contribute to the development of next-generation materials for photovoltaic applications, as well as advancements in the understanding of biological macromolecules and bioelectronic polymers.\n",
      "\n",
      "The computer simulations of electrolyte degradation and SEI formation will provide atomistic insights into electrolyte reactivity. This knowledge will help identify design rules for the development of novel electrolytes, enabling the production of long-lasting and reliable metal-ion batteries. By improving battery performance, this research will have a significant impact on enhancing sustainable energy solutions and reducing our reliance on internal combustion engines in the transportation sector.\n",
