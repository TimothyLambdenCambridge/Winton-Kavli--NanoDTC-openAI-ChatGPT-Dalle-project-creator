      "Abstract:\n",
      "This research proposal aims to investigate the nanoscale structure and photophysical properties of perovskite materials using advanced electron microscopy techniques. Specifically, the proposal combines the expertise of two students, Timothy Lambden and Alex Oddo, who have been conducting research in the field of materials science and nanotechnology. Timothy's expertise lies in cryogenic scanning transmission electron microscopy (Cryo-STEM), while Alex focuses on the synthesis and characterization of cesium lead bromide perovskites. By combining their techniques and knowledge, we aim to gain a fundamental understanding of how the semiconductor structure, morphology, and size govern the photophysical properties of perovskite materials.\n",
      "\n",
      "Introduction:\n",
      "Significant advancements in electron microscopy have made it possible to investigate the nanoscale structure of beam-sensitive materials, including perovskites, with high precision and minimal sample damage. These advances have opened up new avenues for research, particularly in the field of energy conversion and optoelectronic devices. Perovskite semiconductors, such as cesium lead bromide perovskites, show great potential for various applications, including solar cells. To fully exploit their potential, it is crucial to understand how the structure, morphology, and size of these materials affect their photophysical properties.\n",
      "\n",
      "Methods:\n",
      "The proposed research will utilize cryogenic scanning transmission electron microscopy (Cryo-STEM) to investigate the nanoscale structure of perovskite materials. Cryo-STEM allows for the imaging of beam-sensitive materials while minimizing radiation damage. A key aspect of this research will be the optimization of acquisition strategies to maximize data quality without significant sample damage. This will involve the development of ice-free cryo holders and the optimization of smart scanning and in-painting techniques. Additionally, the synthesis and characterization of cesium lead bromide perovskites will be carried out, focusing on their semiconductor structure, morphology, and size using advanced microscopy and spectroscopy techniques.\n",
      "\n",
      "Expected Results:\n",
      "Through the combined efforts of Timothy and Alex, we anticipate obtaining detailed insights into the nanoscale structure and photophysical properties of perovskite materials. The Cryo-STEM experiments will provide high-resolution images of perovskite nanowires, allowing for the examination of their structural characteristics at the atomic level. Additionally, the synthesis and characterization of cesium lead bromide perovskites will provide valuable information on their photophysical properties, such as bandgap, photoluminescence quantum yield, charge carrier lifetime, and the interplay of phonon coupling. These results will contribute to a deeper understanding of how the semiconductor structure, morphology, and size influence the optoelectronic properties of perovskite materials.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sustainable Impact:\n",
      "The research proposed here has significant implications for the development of efficient and sustainable optoelectronic devices, particularly solar cells. By understanding the underlying factors that govern the photophysical properties of perovskite materials, it becomes possible to optimize their performance and enhance their overall efficiency. This knowledge can lead to the design and fabrication of high-performance perovskite-based devices, contributing to the advancement of renewable energy technologies.\n",
      "\n",
      "Conclusion:\n",
      "By combining cryogenic scanning transmission electron microscopy and the synthesis and characterization of cesium lead bromide perovskites, this research proposal aims to investigate the nanoscale structure and photophysical properties of perovskite materials. The collaboration between Timothy Lambden and Alex Oddo brings together expertise in advanced microscopy techniques and perovskite synthesis, respectively, paving the way for a comprehensive understanding of these promising materials. The outcomes of this research will have wide-ranging applications in the field of materials science, particularly in the development of sustainable and efficient optoelectronic devices.\n"
